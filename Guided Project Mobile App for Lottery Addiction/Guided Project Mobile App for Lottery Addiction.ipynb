    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",

    "addicts better estimate their chances of winning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into \n",
    "> addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to \n",
    "> accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery \n",
    "> addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they \n",
    "> need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the [6/49 lottery](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49>) and \n",
    "> build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "> * What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "> * What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The [data set](<https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset>) has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional — the main purpose is to applying probability, permutations \n",
    "> and combinations concepts in the setting that simulates a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Thus **our goal in this project is to write code that can enable users to answer probability questions about playing the \n",
