    "In this project, we're going to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. **Our goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).**\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the algorithm, we'll use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection>). The data collection process is described in more details on [this page](<http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/#composition>), where you can also find some of the papers authored by Tiago A.

    "To better understand the purpose of putting a test set aside, let's begin by observing that all 1,114 messages in our test set are already classified by a human. When the spam filter is ready, we're going to treat these messages as new and have the filter classify them. Once we have the results, we'll be able to compare the algorithm classification with that done by a human initially, and this way we'll see how good the spam filter really is.\n",
